# Topic Naming Lint Baseline (OMN-3188)
#
# Pre-existing topic naming violations tracked for future cleanup.
# Topics listed here are excluded from the linter's failure criteria.
#
# DO NOT add new topics to this list. New violations must be fixed before merging.
# Remove entries as violations are resolved.
#
# Format: one raw topic string per line (comments start with #)
#
# Tracked violations:
#   onex.int.platform.runtime-tick.v1              — invalid kind 'int' (should be 'evt')
#   onex.contract.resolve.completed                — only 4 segments (legacy topic)
#   onex.contract.resolve.requested                — only 4 segments (legacy topic)
#   onex.snapshot.platform.registration-snapshots.v1 — invalid kind 'snapshot'
