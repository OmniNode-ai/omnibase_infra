"""Live half of the cross-repo ``uses:`` pin resolution gate (OMN-14941).

Static extraction + pin-expectation regression tests live in
``tests/ci/test_workflow_uses_refs_resolve.py`` (hermetic, run at pre-push by
the governed impacted-test selector). This module holds ONLY the live GitHub
contents-API resolution test, and lives under ``tests/integration/`` because:

* the pre-push selector ALWAYS ignores ``tests/integration`` by design (it
  needs live infra — ``scripts/hooks/prepush_smart_tests.sh``), and this test
  needs the live GitHub API;
* the enforcement surface of this gate is CI (the full-suite job runs all of
  ``tests/`` excluding only ``tests/integration/docker`` and the
  slow/chaos/kafka/performance markers), where it FAILS CLOSED: a definitive
  404 fails, and an unverifiable pin (no network / rate-limited) also fails
  when ``CI`` is set;
* keeping the born-path sequencing honest: while the omniclaude OMN-14941 PR
  (call-occ-companion-effect-reusable.yml) is unmerged, the @dev pin in
  call-occ-companion-effect.yml is a genuine 404 and this test is
  DELIBERATELY RED in CI on this repo — that red must not also make the
  branch unpushable at the local pre-push hook, which is exactly what
  happened when this test sat in ``tests/ci/``.
