"""Keep hook-subprocess tests from spending a real lab host's cores (OMN-16991).

Several tests in this directory run the REAL pre-push hook with the heavy
escalation forced (``PREPUSH_FULL_SUITE=1``) and every designated host
de-designated, to prove the refusal. Until OMN-16991 that was harmless: the
hook's host scan was truncated after its first ssh probe, so the picker only
ever saw ``h200`` and never had a remote host to dispatch to.

Fixing the scan removed that accidental containment. Observed live on
2026-08-30, minutes after the fix: `pytest tests/ci/` shipped a real git bundle
to ``omnibook``, took that host's exclusive slot, and started the full
``tests/unit/`` suite there -- ORIGIN on the remote wrapper named this very test
process. That is the OMN-16425/OMN-16489 F-01 recursion in its distributed form,
reached from a unit test instead of a push, and it burns a lab host for an hour
per test run.

The isolation below uses the picker's OWN deterministic override surface rather
than a new knob. ``PREPUSH_SLOT_OVERRIDE_MAP`` is consulted before any network
call, and a label absent from the map resolves to "slot unknown", which the
picker treats as unfit and skips -- the same fail-closed posture it applies to
an unreachable host. A map naming no real label therefore makes EVERY row unfit
with zero ssh, and stays correct when a row is added.

It can only make the gate stricter. With no host placeable the lab leg produces
no evidence and the hook falls through to its pre-existing precedence
(GitHub-hosted verify -> grant -> die), which is exactly what these tests assert.
