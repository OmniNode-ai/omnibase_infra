"""Guards for lab-wide pre-push distribution (OMN-16991).

Three things are pinned here, because all three were structural defects rather
than bugs in a computation:

1. **The host table is the identity authority, read from the COMMITTED tree.**
   The guard used to test two hard-coded hostnames -- a literal ``||`` that was
   the entire reason ``.101``/``.105`` could not be used. The full table
   contents are asserted, so adding or promoting a host requires a reviewed
   commit *and* a deliberate edit here.

2. **Placement reads SLOT state before load.** Measured 2026-08-30: ``.201``
   showed the fittest load ratio in the lab (14.08/32 = 0.44x) while running
   three concurrent pre-push suites behind a 10-deep queue. A load-only picker
   routes a fourth run onto the most jammed host in the fleet.

3. **Nothing here may make the gate accept less work.** The precedence tests
   pin the GitHub-hosted sha-pinned run ahead of the lab leg, and pin that a
   remote RED refuses instead of falling through to the override grant.

The bash helpers are extract-and-executed (the pattern already used for this
hook's other pure shell functions) so the assertions run THE code that ships,
never a Python re-implementation that could pass while the shipped picker is
broken.
