# Database Migrations - Consolidated Guide

**Note**: Database migration documentation has been consolidated into a single comprehensive guide.

**📍 See**: **[docs/database/DATABASE_MIGRATIONS.md](../database/DATABASE_MIGRATIONS.md)**

---

## What Changed?

**Date**: October 29, 2025

The two separate database migration guides have been merged:
- ~~docs/database/DATABASE_MIGRATIONS.md~~ (Technical guide)
- ~~docs/deployment/DATABASE_MIGRATIONS.md~~ (Operational guide)

**New Location**: `docs/database/DATABASE_MIGRATIONS.md` (Consolidated v2.0)

---

## Why the Change?

Having two separate migration guides caused confusion:
- ❌ Duplicate information across two files
- ❌ Unclear which guide to use
- ❌ Inconsistent updates between versions

The consolidated guide provides:
- ✅ Single source of truth
- ✅ Unified audience (developers + DevOps + SREs)
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage (technical + operational)
- ✅ Clear navigation with quick start sections
