# Security Patterns

**Category**: Protection and Compliance
**Pattern Count**: 0 (will be populated in Task F2)

## Overview

Security patterns ensure nodes handle sensitive data safely and protect against common vulnerabilities.

## Expected Patterns

1. **Input Validation** - Validate and sanitize all inputs
2. **Sanitization** - Remove or escape dangerous content
3. **Field Redaction** - Hide sensitive fields in logs/outputs
4. **Authentication** - Verify identity of callers
5. **Authorization** - Control access to resources

## Security Principles

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of protection
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights
- **Fail Secure**: Fail in a secure state
- **Audit Trail**: Log security-relevant events

## Next Steps

Patterns will be extracted from production nodes during Task F2.
