# Performance Patterns

**Category**: Optimization and Efficiency
**Pattern Count**: 0 (will be populated in Task F2)

## Overview

Performance patterns optimize resource usage and improve system efficiency.

## Expected Patterns

1. **Connection Pooling** - Reuse database/HTTP connections
2. **Caching** - Store frequently accessed data in memory
3. **Batching** - Group operations for efficiency
4. **Streaming** - Process data incrementally
5. **Lazy Loading** - Defer expensive operations until needed

## Performance Principles

- **Measure First**: Profile before optimizing
- **Appropriate Tradeoffs**: Balance performance vs complexity
- **Resource Efficiency**: Minimize CPU, memory, I/O
- **Scalability**: Consider concurrent workloads

## Next Steps

Patterns will be extracted from production nodes during Task F2.
