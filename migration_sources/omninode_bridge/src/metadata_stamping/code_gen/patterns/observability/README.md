# Observability Patterns

**Category**: Monitoring and Debugging
**Pattern Count**: 0 (will be populated in Task F2)

## Overview

Observability patterns enable monitoring, debugging, and understanding system behavior in production environments.

## Expected Patterns

1. **Metrics Collection** - Track operational metrics (latency, throughput, errors)
2. **Health Checks** - Component-level health monitoring
3. **Structured Logging** - Consistent, queryable log format
4. **Distributed Tracing** - Request flow tracking across services
5. **Performance Monitoring** - Resource usage and performance tracking

## Key Principles

- **Minimal Overhead**: Observability should not significantly impact performance
- **Structured Data**: Use structured formats for easy querying
- **Correlation IDs**: Track requests across services
- **Sampling**: Sample high-volume data to reduce overhead

## Next Steps

Patterns will be extracted from production nodes during Task F2.
