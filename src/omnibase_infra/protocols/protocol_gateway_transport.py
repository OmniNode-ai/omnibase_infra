"""POST seam for the ``onex auth`` gateway client (OMN-15922).

The gateway client is pure logic over THIS protocol; the one component that
actually opens a socket is the EFFECT adapter that implements it
(``omnibase_infra.gateway.client.gateway_transport_httpx``). Keeping
the seam means the whole credential -> JWT -> Bearer -> attach -> re-attach
cycle is driven in tests by an in-memory fake, with no network and no sleeping,
while the concrete adapter stays small enough to read in one sitting.

Why a distinct protocol rather than adding ``post`` to ``ProtocolHttpClient``:
    ``ProtocolHttpClient`` is ``@runtime_checkable`` and is already satisfied
    structurally by adapters implementing exactly ``get``. Adding a method
    would silently un-satisfy every one of them -- a breaking change to an
    existing seam in service of a new caller. The two POST shapes this client
    needs are also genuinely different concerns: an OAuth2 token endpoint takes
    ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` (RFC 6749 s2.3.1) and the gateway
    takes JSON, and collapsing them into one ``post(body)`` would push
    content-type assembly into every caller.

Both methods return ``ProtocolHttpResponse`` -- the response seam ``omnibase_core``
already defines -- so an implementation reuses whatever adapter it has. Callers
here read ``status`` and ``text()`` only, never ``json()``: the bodies are
parsed through typed Pydantic models, so an ``Any``-returning hop would throw
away the typing the models exist to provide.
