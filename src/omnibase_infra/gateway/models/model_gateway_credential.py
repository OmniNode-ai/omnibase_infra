"""ModelGatewayCredential -- one tenant's machine identity for the gateway (OMN-15922).

The resolved form of what ``~/.onex`` holds: the per-tenant confidential
Keycloak client (``client_credentials`` grant, ``clientId`` == the immutable
``principal_id``) plus the two contract-supplied URLs it is used against.

``client_secret`` is a ``SecretStr`` deliberately. This model is constructed on
the CLI path, passed into services, and therefore ends up inside tracebacks,
``repr()`` output and structured log records whenever anything downstream
raises. ``SecretStr`` renders as ``**********`` in every one of those, which is
the only reason a plain-string field would ever have been "fine until it
wasn't". Read the value only where it is about to go on the wire, via
``get_secret_value()``.

No field here is optional. A half-configured credential is exactly the state
that produces an anonymous call the operator believes is authenticated, so
absence is resolved (and refused) at the store boundary, never represented.
