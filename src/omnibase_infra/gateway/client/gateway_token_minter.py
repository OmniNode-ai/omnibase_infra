"""GatewayTokenMinter — credential -> gateway JWT (OMN-15922).

One ``client_credentials`` grant against the tenant realm's token endpoint,
one audience assertion, one in-memory cache. Deliberately no ``refresh_token``
path: RFC 6749 §4.4.3 says the client-credentials grant SHOULD NOT issue one,
and Keycloak does not -- so "refresh" here means re-grant, which is also
exactly what the gateway's RE_ATTACH renewal mode assumes its clients do.

WHAT THE AUDIENCE CHECK IS, AND IS NOT
    It is NOT a security control. This client verifies no signature and holds
    no JWKS; the gateway does that (``service_keycloak_token_validator`` on the
    node, ``gateway_auth.py`` at the edge). A forged token would sail past this
    check and die at the gateway, which is the correct place for it to die.

    It IS a fail-fast against a live, specific, already-observed defect: the
    P0B per-tenant provisioner stamps only ``aud=redpanda-events``
    (``keycloak_client_manager.py`` BROKER_TOKEN_AUDIENCE), while attach
    requires exact set equality with ``{"gateway-attach"}``. Without this
    check, a correctly-configured operator with a genuinely broken credential
    sees an opaque 401 from a remote service several calls downstream. With
    it, they see which audience they got and which was needed, at the mint.

    The comparison is SET EQUALITY, mirroring the gateway rather than being
    merely compatible with it. A superset (a dual-audience broker+attach token)
    is rejected there and so is rejected here -- a client that accepted more
    than the gateway does would report success and then fail on the wire.

CACHING
    In memory, per instance, re-granted once ``now`` reaches ``exp - skew``.
    Not written to disk: a cached bearer on disk is a credential at rest with
    none of the protections the actual credential file gets, in exchange for
    saving one sub-second grant per process.
