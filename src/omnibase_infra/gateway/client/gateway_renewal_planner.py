"""GatewayRenewalPlanner — the client half of the RE_ATTACH cycle (OMN-15922).

The server computes the window and hands it over on the attach response
(OMN-15952, ``service_gateway_renewal_policy`` on the node). This class does
not recompute it -- recomputing would make the client a second authority over
a term the contract already settled, and the two would drift the first time the
node's ``renewal_margin_seconds`` changed. It reads the directive and answers
three questions about it:

  * ``plan_instant``  -- which moment inside the jitter window is mine?
  * ``is_renewal_due`` -- has that window opened?
  * ``assert_window_is_honourable`` -- can I still make it?

Every method is pure: ``now`` and the random generator are both injected. That
is what makes the boundary cases (a token whose whole life is shorter than the
margin, an instant exactly at ``renew_not_before``) driveable by tests rather
than sleepable-through.

WHY THE JITTER DRAW IS AN INJECTED GENERATOR
    A fleet provisioned in one bootstrap batch shares an attach instant, so
    without spreading it shares a renewal instant -- and the synchronisation is
    self-sustaining, because a batch that renews together stays together.
    Taking a ``random.Random`` rather than calling the module-level ``random``
    lets a test prove the draw actually spreads, instead of asserting only that
    each individual result is inside the window (which a constant would satisfy).
