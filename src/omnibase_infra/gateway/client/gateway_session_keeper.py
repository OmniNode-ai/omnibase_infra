"""GatewaySessionKeeper — Bearer on every gateway call (OMN-15922).

The one place a gateway request is constructed, so that a token is never
hand-passed and no code path can produce an anonymous call. Every request here
goes through ``_post``, which takes the Authorization header from the minter
rather than from an argument -- an anonymous call is not something a caller can
express, which is a stronger property than every caller remembering to pass one.

THE RENEWAL CYCLE THIS IMPLEMENTS (OMN-15952, contract 0.3.0)
    ``expires_at`` is stamped once at attach, from
    ``min(token exp, max_session_ttl_seconds)``, and nothing moves it. A
    heartbeat proves liveness and non-revocation; it buys no time. So
    ``ensure_attached`` does not "renew" -- inside the jitter window it performs
    a fresh ``client_credentials`` grant and a fresh attach, minting a NEW
    ``session_id``. Continuity across the boundary is this object's property,
    never the session record's.

FAIL-CLOSED
    An expired session is refused locally, before a request is sent: the client
    already holds ``expires_at``, so spending a round trip to be told what it
    knows is both slower and, if the gateway is unreachable, indistinguishable
    from an outage. A rejected call raises. There is no branch on which a dead
    session is used and no branch on which failure degrades to a local path --
    a locally-successful delegation while the operator believes it ran in cloud
    is the exact failure this refusal exists to prevent.
