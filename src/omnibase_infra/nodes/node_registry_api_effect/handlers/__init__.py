"""Handlers package for NodeRegistryApiEffect.

Handler implementations are declared in ``contract.yaml`` for ONEX
introspection / discovery.  The actual request-handling logic lives in
``services/registry_api/service.py`` and is invoked via the FastAPI
route layer.  This package is a placeholder that keeps the ONEX node
directory structure compliant.
