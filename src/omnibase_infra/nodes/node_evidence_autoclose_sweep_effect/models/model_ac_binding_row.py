"""One row of the acceptance-criterion / evidence-check binding table.

OMN-18056. The closer's flip predicate counted checks and never asked which
criterion any of them covered. Counters can refute "every criterion is
covered by a verified probative check"; they cannot say WHICH criterion is
not covered, and on the nine tickets adjudicated in closeout sweep run 2 the
criterion that decided the ticket was, in every held case, bound to no check
at all.

A row is the join the counters could not express: one acceptance criterion,
and one evidence check that DECLARES it (``binds_ac`` on the contract's
evidence item, surfaced per check on the dod_verify verdict). A criterion no
check declares gets exactly one row with an empty ``evidence_check`` — the absence
is a fact the record has to state, not one it may omit, because an AC with no
row is indistinguishable from an AC nobody parsed.
