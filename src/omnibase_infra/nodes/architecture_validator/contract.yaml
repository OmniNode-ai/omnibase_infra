# =============================================================================
# ARCHITECTURE RULES VALIDATED
# =============================================================================
# This COMPUTE node validates three critical architecture rules:
#
#   ARCH-001: No Direct Handler Dispatch
#     Handlers MUST NOT be invoked directly bypassing the RuntimeHost.
#     All event routing MUST go through the MessageDispatchEngine.
#
#   ARCH-002: No Handler Publishing Events
#     Handlers MUST NOT have direct event bus access. Only orchestrators
#     may publish events. Handlers return events; orchestrators publish.
#
#   ARCH-003: No Workflow FSM in Orchestrators
#     Orchestrators MUST NOT duplicate reducer FSM transitions in workflow
#     steps. Reducers own FSM; orchestrators coordinate workflow execution.

# Description
description: >
  COMPUTE node for validating ONEX architecture patterns. Analyzes Python source code and module structures to detect architecture violations. Validates three core rules: ARCH-001 (no direct handler dispatch), ARCH-002 (no handler publishing events), and ARCH-003 (no workflow FSM in orchestrators duplicating reducer transitions). Returns a structured validation result with violations grouped by rule and severity.

# Strongly typed I/O models
input_model:
  name: "ModelArchitectureValidationRequest"
  module: "omnibase_infra.nodes.architecture_validator.models"
  description: >
    Input containing paths to validate, optional rule filters, and validation configuration (strict mode, ignore patterns, etc.).

output_model:
  name: "ModelArchitectureValidationResult"
  module: "omnibase_infra.nodes.architecture_validator.models"
  description: >
    Output containing validation results: overall pass/fail status, violations grouped by rule (ARCH-001, ARCH-002, ARCH-003), severity levels, and suggested fixes for each violation.

# Validation rules with detection strategies

        - "unit_test_mocks"
    suggested_fix: >
      Route events through RuntimeHost.process_event() or MessageDispatchEngine.dispatch() instead of calling handlers directly.

  - rule_id: "ARCH-002"
    name: "No Handler Publishing Events"
    description: >
      Handlers MUST NOT have direct event bus access. Only orchestrators may publish events. Handlers return events; orchestrators publish.

        - "*Handler"
    suggested_fix: >
      Remove event bus injection from handler. Return events from handle() method; let the orchestrator publish them.

  - rule_id: "ARCH-003"
    name: "No Workflow FSM in Orchestrators"
    description: >
      Orchestrators MUST NOT duplicate reducer FSM transitions in workflow steps. Reducers own FSM; orchestrators coordinate workflow execution.

    severity: "MAJOR"
    detection_strategy:
      type: "contract_analysis"
      checks:
        - no_state_transitions_in_workflow
        - no_fsm_definitions_in_orchestrator
      target_files:
        - "contract.yaml"
        - "node.py"
    suggested_fix: >
      Remove state transition logic from orchestrator. State transitions belong exclusively to reducer nodes. Orchestrators should call reducers for FSM decisions.
