# Migration Freeze
#
# This file signals that schema migrations are FROZEN in this repository.
# Do NOT add new migration files while this freeze is active.
#
# Parent ticket: OMN-2055 (DB-SPLIT-04: Schema freeze)
# Repo ticket:   OMN-2071
# Reason:        DB-per-repo refactor in progress
#
# Allowed during freeze:
#   - Migration file moves (reorg between repos)
#   - Table ownership fixes (transfers)
#   - Rollback bug fixes (DB-SPLIT-01)
#
# NOT allowed:
#   - New schema migrations
#   - Column additions/removals
#   - Index changes
#   - Any DDL that creates new migration files
#
# To lift this freeze:
#   1. Confirm DB boundary work is complete for this repo
#   2. Remove this file
#   3. Open a PR referencing the parent ticket OMN-2055
